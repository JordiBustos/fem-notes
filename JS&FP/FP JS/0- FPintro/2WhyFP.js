/*
  When you know exactly what output you gonna get given what input
  you get code code that's much predictable.
  Easier to test/debug.

  Why use FP paradigm in JS?
    Object oriented JS gets tricky -> prototypes, this, etc.
    FP function are more predictable and concrete

  Each function should do only one kind of computation or operation.
  We can make really complex function out of much simpler functions
  There is a tendency to have functions with few lines of code for that reason.
