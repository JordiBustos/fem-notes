Clarifying inheritance

In classical oriented languages C++, Java, etc:
    When you make a class Workshop and you instatiate it, you are
    conceptually and some times physically copying down into those instances

    And when we make child classes that extends from workshop we are copying down into that again
    And when we instantiate the child class we are making more copies


Prototypal Inheritance:
  We have Workshop.prototype object and then we make another object that are linked to Workshop.prototype
  The child prototypes and its instances are linked too to Workshop.prototype


  JavaScript "inheritance" -> "Behavior Delegation"
                              It's not a class system
