JavaScript is single threaded (one command executing at a time)
and has synchronous execution model (each line is executed in order the code appears).

So what if we need to wait some time before we can execute certain bits of code?
Perhaps we need to wait on fresh data from an API/server request or for a time to complete
and then execute our code.

We have a conundrum -a tension between wanting to delay some code execution
but not wanting to block the thread for any further code running while we wait.
