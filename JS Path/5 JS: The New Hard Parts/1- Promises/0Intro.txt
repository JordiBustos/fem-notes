Promises:

Special objects built into JS that get returned inmediately when we make a call to a web browser api/feature
(e.g fetch) that's set up to return promises

Act as a placeholder for the data we hope to get back
from the web browser feature's background work

We also attach the functionality we want to defer running until that background work is done

Promise objects will automatically trigger that functionality to run and the value returned from the web browser
will be that function's argument. This functionality is stored on a hidden property of the promise called on fulfillment (array of fns)
